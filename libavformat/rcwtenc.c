/*
 * Raw Captions With Time (RCWT) is a format native to ccextractor, a commonly
 * used open source tool for processing 608/708 closed caption (CC) sources.
 * It can be used to archive the original, raw CC bitstream and to produce
 * a source file for later CC processing or conversion. As a result,
 * it also allows for interopability with ccextractor for processing CC data
 * extracted via ffmpeg. The format is simple to parse and can be used
 * to retain all lines and variants of CC.
 *
 * This muxer implements the specification as of 2024-01-05, which has
 * been stable and unchanged for 10 years as of this writing.
 *
 * This muxer will have some nuances from the way that ccextractor muxes RCWT.
 * No compatibility issues when processing the output with ccextractor
 * have been observed as a result of this so far, but mileage may vary
 * and outputs will not be a bit-exact match.
 *
 * Specifically, the differences are:
 * (1) This muxer will identify as "FF" as the writing program identifier, so
 *     as to be honest about the output's origin.
 *
 * (2) ffmpeg's MPEG-1/2, H264, HEVC, etc. decoders extract closed captioning
 *     data differently than ccextractor from embedded SEI/user data.
 *     For example, DVD captioning bytes will be translated to ATSC A53 format.
 *     This allows ffmpeg to handle 608/708 in a consistant way downstream.
 *     This is a lossless conversion and the meaningful data is retained.
 *
 * (3) This muxer will not alter the extracted data except to remove invalid
 *     packets in between valid CC blocks. On the other hand, ccextractor
 *     will by default remove mid-stream padding, and add padding at the end
 *     of the stream (in order to convey the end time of the source video).
 *
